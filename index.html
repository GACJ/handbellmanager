<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Many handbell ringers have been looking for a better way to practice ringing two handbells with change
ringing simulators than pressing keys on the keyboard. Here, at last, is a cheap and easy way to obtain and use dummy handbells.</p>
<p>Handbell Manager is free software (under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GNU General Public Licence</a>) that enables USB motion controllers to be used as dummy handbells with Abel or Beltower.</p>
<p>Click on play below to see a demonstration video of three leads of Bristol using Abel, Handbell Manager and ActionXL wired motion controllers.</p>

<p>There is no computer keyboard or mouse interaction during the video - the controllers are swung to ring two bells, and buttons on the controllers are used to start the others ringing, initiate "Go Bristol" and call the three bobs.</p>
