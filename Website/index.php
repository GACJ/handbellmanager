<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Many handbell ringers have been looking for a better way to practice ringing two handbells with Abel's change
ringing simulator than pressing keys on the keyboard. Here, at last, is a cheap and easy way to obtain and use dummy handbells.</p>
<p>Handbell Manager is free software (under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GNU General Public Licence</a>) that enables USB motion controllers to be used as dummy handbells with Abel.</p>
<p>For background on this project, visit the <a href="background.php">Background</a> page, or for features of the software see the <a href="HMHelp.htm">Handbell Manager help file</a>.</p>
<p>If you a software developer, the source code for Handbell Manager is available from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/handbellmanager">Sourceforge</a>.</p>

<p>Click on play below to see a demonstration video of three leads of Bristol using Abel, Handbell Manager and ActionXL wired motion controllers.

<h3>Abel Enhancements</h3>
<p>As a result of discussions with Chris Hughes, author of Abel, during the development of Handbell Manager,
some enhancements to Abel were identified that will make ringing dummy handbells much easier. 
In particular, the introduction of moving rather than flipping handbells on screen makes handbell "ropesight"
very much easier to see. Together with the use of dummy handbells, these enhancements take the experience of
ringing handbells with Abel a big step closer to the real thing.</p>
